#### BEGINNER NOTEBOOK HINTS EXERCISES 1-7 ####

# Full solutions will be posted at the end of the session. 

# Exercise 1:
# here is how to initialize a single qubit pauli operation
pauli_op = Pauli('I')
# the pauli class has the built in method to_matrix() to print its corresponding matrix

# Extra: Why is the dimensions of a 3-qubit pauli operation an 8x8 matrix? (review tensor product of matrices)

# Exercise 2:
# you can initialize a quantum circuit like this where the first parameter is the number of qubits
# 3 qubit circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(3)

# you can apply a gate to the circuit like this
# not gate applied the the first qubit
qc.x(1)
# you can view the dirac notation of a circuit by initializing a Statevector object
# and then running the draw method on it
# https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/api/qiskit/qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector 


# Exercise 3:
# the hardest part of this problem is determining what value to use for theta

# sin(θ/2) is equal to the square root of the probability of measuring state 1 (in our case 85.4%)
# sin(θ/2) = sqrt(.854)
# now try solving for θ and then passing it as the rotation angle for your ry gate 


# Exercise 4:
# the bell state is considered the "Hello World!" of quatum circuits
# https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials/hello-world
# you can draw a QC using qc.draw("mpl")


# Exercise 5:
# Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state is an entangled quantum state that involves at least qubits
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state 
# For 3 qubits it is very similar to the bell state with an additional control not gate between
# the 0 and 2 qubit

# Extra: Can you print the probabilities of this vector? How would you explain these probabilities given that all of the qubits are entangled?


# Exercise 6: 
# We saw an introduction to dynamic quantum circuits with Alberto yesterday!
# Here is your chance to code some basic dynamic circuit logic.

# to create a circuit with a classical bit populate the second parameter of the QC initialization
# ex. 2 qubits, 1 classical bit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 1)

# you can measure a qubit to a classical register like this 
# ex. qubit 0 is measured and the results are stored in classical bit 0
qc.measure(0, 0)

# Exercise 7: 
# Now it time to get results from circuits we build!
# Here are some example docs on running the Sampler using the AerSimulator backend
